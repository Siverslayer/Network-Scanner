# Network Scanner

The Network Scanner is a tool designed to discover and analyze devices and services on a computer network.

## Introduction

Network scanning is the process of identifying active hosts, open ports, and other network services within a specified range of IP addresses. The Network Scanner tool automates this process, allowing users to map out the network topology, detect potential security vulnerabilities, and gather information about networked devices and services.

## Features

- **IP Range Scan:** Specify a range of IP addresses to scan for active hosts.
- **Port Scanning:** Detect open ports and services on discovered hosts to identify potential attack vectors.
- **Service Identification:** Identify the type and version of services running on open ports to assess security risks.
- **Network Mapping:** Create a visual map of the network topology, showing connections between devices and services.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Perform vulnerability scans to identify known security vulnerabilities on networked devices.
- **Customization:** Customize scan parameters and options to tailor the scanning process to specific requirements.

## Usage

1. **Target Selection:** Specify the range of IP addresses or subnet to scan for active hosts.
2. **Scan Options:** Choose the type of scan (e.g., ping scan, TCP SYN scan) and configure scan parameters.
3. **Initiate Scan:** Start the network scan and monitor the progress through the provided interface.
4. **Analysis:** Analyze the scan results to identify active hosts, open ports, and potential security vulnerabilities.
5. **Reporting:** Generate reports summarizing the findings of the network scan, including recommendations for remediation.

## Warning

Network scanning can potentially disrupt network communication and may be subject to legal restrictions depending on the jurisdiction. It is important to obtain proper authorization before conducting network scans, especially on systems or networks that you do not own or administer.
